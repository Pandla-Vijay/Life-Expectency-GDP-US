This project involves visualizing US GDP data using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, focusing on trends and relationships between country, year, life expectancy at birth, and GDP. After loading and cleaning the data to ensure accuracy, various visualizations were created, including line plots to show GDP growth over the years, scatter plots to explore the relationship between GDP and life expectancy, and bar charts to compare GDP across different years. These visualizations provide insights into the economic and social development of the US.
